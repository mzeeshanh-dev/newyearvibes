Triggers a large celebration when countdown reaches zero

Fullscreen mode uses the Fullscreen API

Snowfall runs continuously using canvas

🎨 UI Highlights

Glassmorphism card with blur & transparency

Animated snow overlay

Clean typography and spacing

Footer attribution with external profile link
